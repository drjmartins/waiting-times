"""Shared ODS (Organisation Data Service) org-status classification.

ONE source of truth for BOTH dashboards: an ICB/trust is "former" regardless of
which dashboard you view it in, so the classification lives in a single shared
cache file (CACHE_PATH) that the cancer and RTT builds both annotate against.

What it produces, per org code that is touched by a merger/closure:

    {"<CODE>": {
        "name": "NHS FRIMLEY INTEGRATED CARE BOARD",
        "status": "former" | "current",
        "closed":  "2026-04-01" | null,   # supersession / legal-close date
        "opened":  "2026-04-01" | null,   # creation date (for newly-formed orgs)
        "successors":   [{"code": "...", "name": "..."}, ...],
        "predecessors": [{"code": "...", "name": "..."}, ...]}}

Only succession-affected orgs (those with a predecessor/successor link, or that
are ODS-Inactive) appear in the cache. Any code ABSENT from the cache is treated
as CURRENT/visible by the builds — fail-open, never drop an org.

KEY DESIGN POINT (verified live 2026-06): ODS keeps a closed org operationally
`Status: Active` through a ~6-month migration overlap, so Status alone MISSES a
just-happened merger. We therefore classify FORMER from the SUCCESSION LINK with a
legal start date that has already passed (with Status==Inactive as a catch-all for
orgs already past their overlap).

FAIL-SOFT: `refresh_or_cache()` tries a live fetch; on ANY failure (network, HTTP,
schema drift) it logs a warning and returns the last-known committed cache, so the
daily data update never crashes and never silently loses orgs. The cache is stamped
only with an ODS-derived `as_of` (max LastChangeDate seen), never a per-run
timestamp, so it commits only when ODS itself changed (respects the CI
no-op-commit guard).
