_Last updated: 2026-06-25 (Claude Code session; CWT FY-boundary staleness fix BUILT + demonstrated, NOT deployed)._

## 🛠 BUILT + DEMONSTRATED, NOT DEPLOYED ⏸ 2026-06-25 — CWT financial-year-boundary staleness fix
Cancer pipeline now ALSO scrapes the current-FY sub-page (`{fy}-monthly-cancer-waiting-times-statistics/`) for the
per-MONTH Combined CSVs that appear there before the cumulative file lands on the main page — closing the trail at an
FY boundary (the April-2026 case). Per-month file is column-identical to the cumulative MINUS the `Period` column;
`normalise` injects the month from the filename, guarded. Precedence (user-confirmed): final>provisional, then
cumulative>per-month at equal status, newest-on-tie. **REQUIRED fail-loud month-label guard** (3 layers: refuse
monthly+unparseable filename; refuse no-Period+no-hint; assert single parseable injected month) + national contiguity
guard — the safety net here since cancer has no national-value reconciliation. **68 tests pass** (55 + 13 new).
Demonstrated on REAL data: April-2026 ingested Provisional (store 48→49 months, to 2026-04); guard fires on bad parse;
ten-groups + route recon gates GREEN across the seam. PAUSED before deploy. See DECISIONS 2026-06-25 (×2).

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-23 (run 28040528379, build+deploy GREEN; CI commit 97049ef) — WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility pass (all 4 pages)
**Live checks all pass** (headless on the deployed site, cache-busted). Per-criterion re-confirmed LIVE: 1.1.1
chart `role="img"`+`aria-label` + visually-hidden data tables present AND view-accurate (cancer table 36 rows at
3y → **12 rows at 12mo**, proving it tracks the on-screen window; RTT rate+count 36; compare funnel 157 /
percentile 139; tables render as a 1×1px clipped box, invisible to sighted users); 2.1.1 focus tooltip shows on
keyboard focus (display:block); 4.1.2 segmented `aria-pressed`="true,false,false", modal `role=dialog`+
`aria-modal`, `.wrap` inert while open, focus→close on open + **returned to Expand on close**; 4.1.3 `#live`
present all pages; 1.4.10 **0px** horizontal overflow at 320px (cancer/rtt/compare); 1.4.3 text `--target-text
#9a6600` + `--milestone-text #75632f` live; 1.4.11 lines `--org-muted #4f9aa6` / `--nat #838f95` / `--milestone
#a08a52` live (clean 3:1 pass). Landing + all nav links underlined. Charts still render correctly for sighted
users (verified screenshot: strong org line, provisional dashed tail, England grey present-but-secondary, dark
amber target label). CI: 55 tests pass; RTT recon OK @2025-04 (pct18 0.5973 / waitlist 7,389,065); TF-sum gate
max|Δ|=0 (24,776 org-months); ODS LIVE fetch both pipelines (427 orgs / 353 former / 556 trust codes, as_of
2026-05-07 — not the fallback); provider-type guards intact (build didn't fail). Audience stays professional
(NHS managers/analysts/clinicians) — accessibility only, NO plain-language changes. Audit → fixes → one
trade-off resolved (full line nudge), all in this session (see DECISIONS 2026-06-23 ×3). Shipped across cancer,
rtt, compare.html + landing:
- **1.1.1** every chart `<svg>` → `role="img"` + `<title>`/`<desc>` + summary `aria-label`, PLUS a visually-hidden
  data `<table>` per big chart / funnel / percentile built from the SAME on-screen series (view-accurate:
  measure/group/TF/route/range/England overlay; provisional + low-reliability flags as TEXT). Sparklines get a
  trend `aria-label`.
- **2.1.1** SVG data points keyboard-focusable (`tabindex=0` + per-point `aria-label`); the hover tooltip also
  fires on focus, with a visible focus ring.
- **4.1.2** `aria-pressed` on segmented toggles + cards, `aria-selected` on listbox options, illegal
  search-in-listbox fixed (role moved to options container), expand modal → `role="dialog"`+`aria-modal` + focus
  trap + background `inert` + return-focus-on-close.
- **4.1.3** polite `#live` region announces chart updates + empty/fallback states.
- **1.4.10** no horizontal scroll at 320px (relaxed fixed min-widths, capped native selects, wrap long-waiter
  control). **1.4.1** nav links underlined.
- **1.4.3 text** decoupled: amber "below target" + target-% labels → `--target-text #9a6600` (4.9:1), RTT
  milestone labels → `--milestone-text #75632f` (5.9:1), cancer low-reliability figure → dark ink.
- **1.4.11 lines (full nudge, chosen by user):** low-reliability/provisional `--org-muted #6db0ba→#4f9aa6`
  (3.23:1), England grey `--nat #9aa7ad→#838f95` (3.32:1), milestone `--milestone #b8a06a→#a08a52` (3.36:1) —
  all now clear 3:1, so the earlier "rely on shape+dash redundancy" 1.4.11 stance is MOOT (clean pass). Primary
  solid org line untouched, so the visual hierarchy holds (render-verified headless before deploy).
- Pre-deploy: 55 tests pass; headless confirms tables present + view-accurate, focus tooltips, dialog/inert +
  focus return, `aria` state, live region, 0px 320px overflow, charts still render correctly for sighted users.

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-23 (run 28019834569, build+deploy GREEN; CI commit 9dbac27) — consistency-cluster round (4 changes)
Bundled into one watched workflow_dispatch. **Live checks all pass** (curl + headless on the live site):
RTT picker shows "North East and Yorkshire" beside Airedale (RCF), independent NPR01 + ICBs + National show
none; live data 162/594 providers with a real region, ICBs all England. Cancer header nav = "**Cancer** ·
RTT · All dashboards" with NO visible Compare link; compare.html still 200s. Per-org "Compare this trust"
link present in markup but hidden (href `compare.html?org=RCF&std=CMB62`). Nav consistent across all three
(landing current "All dashboards", cancer "Cancer", rtt "RTT"; same order). compare.html `?org=RCF` live →
scope auto-set to NE&Y + 2 highlight rings. CI: 55 tests, RTT recon OK @2025-04 (pct18 0.5973 / waitlist
7,389,065), TF-sum max|Δ|=0, ODS LIVE fetch for BOTH pipelines (427 orgs / 556 trust codes, as_of
2026-05-07 — not the fallback), provider-type guards intact (build didn't fail). Detail below:
- **RTT region in the provider picker.** The RTT source has no provider region (it wrote "England" for all);
  now it REUSES the cancer dashboard's authoritative (Parent_Org-derived) region, keyed by org code, via new
  shared `pipeline_common/regions.py` reading committed `site/cancer/data/index.json`. So an RTT trust's
  region == the same trust's cancer region by construction. Providers only (ICBs stay "England", matching
  cancer); fail-open to "England" if the cancer index is absent. Front-end byline reuses cancer's exact
  logic. Rebuilt: both gates green (SPN pct18 0.5973 / waitlist 7.39M; TF-sum max|Δ|=0); 162/594 providers
  got a real region, **0 mismatches** across 163 shared codes; independents/ICBs/National show none.
- **CWT comparator soft-hidden.** One CSS rule `.compare-soft-hidden{display:none!important}` hides the header
  "Compare Providers (Beta)" link; compare.html stays live at its URL. Reversal = delete that one rule.
- **Compare-this-trust link (built, soft-hidden).** Per-org cancer link `compare.html?org=<code>&std=<std>`,
  provider-only (JS), hidden via the SAME class so it un-hides with the comparator (no rework). compare.html
  consumes `?org=`: scopes the funnel to the trust's region + rings/labels its point (funnel + percentile).
- **Navigation — Option A across all 3 pages.** Consistent `.dashnav` strip `Cancer · RTT · All dashboards`
  on landing/cancer/rtt, current page bold non-link (`aria-current`), unified `·` separators. Upgrade path to
  a segmented switcher (Option B) noted for when a 3rd dashboard lands. 55 tests pass.

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27966254999, build+deploy GREEN)

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27966254999, build+deploy GREEN)
- **Footer accuracy reword, BOTH dashboards.** Hiding is org-type-agnostic (the inactivity rule keys on
  recent activity, not provider type — dormant NHS trusts are hidden alongside independents: cancer 34
  trusts + 17 independent hidden, RTT 22 + 42), so the RTT footer's "independent-sector providers … are
  hidden" was misleading. Reworded: RTT → "Providers with very little recent activity (no month reaching 100
  on the waiting list in the past year) are hidden. Non-English-commissioned activity is also excluded.";
  cancer → "Organisations with very little recent activity (for providers, no standard reaching at least 10
  patients in a single month over the last year; for commissioners, very low recent total volume) are
  hidden." Provider-type-filter mention deliberately dropped (toggle is self-evident in the UI). Live-
  verified: both footers render with the new copy, clean punctuation, dynamic dates intact.

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27964831412, build+deploy GREEN)
- **"Formed / new organisation" note scoped to genuine recent formations, BOTH dashboards.** It previously
  fired on any current org with predecessor links (wrongly on e.g. Oxford RTH, formed 2011). Now shows only
  when BOTH: the DATA series is truncated (starts > Apr-2022 floor + ~2mo) AND a predecessor itself closed
  within the data window (a real handoff — uses reliable succession close-dates, not the sparse ODS
  formation date). Both needed: truncation alone over-fires on late-reporting MH/ambulance trusts (which
  carry old-merger predecessor links); the handoff alone fires on a boundary gainer (QRL). Closed/Former
  note unchanged (asymmetric). Live: RTT RTH/R1L/QRL no note, Z9B2Z Formed note, QNQ Former unchanged;
  cancer RTH no note, QNQ Former unchanged. Formed notes now = RTT 6 (the 2026 ICBs) / cancer 0 (until April
  CWT lands). 53 tests. See DECISIONS 2026-06-22.
  (Footer-accuracy reword that this entry flagged as pending is now DEPLOYED — see the top entry.)

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27962238975, build+deploy GREEN; CI commit a11c663)
- **Provider-type hardening + cache-bust, BOTH dashboards.** Follow-up to a reported "RTT Independent Sector
  empty" — root cause was a stale browser/CDN cache skew (new index.html + cached pre-`ptype` index.json);
  the deployed data was correct (423 RTT independents tagged, all matched). Shipped two fail-loud guards +
  the real recurrence-fix:
  - **Guards:** `ods.assert_independents_tagged` makes a dashboard with providers fail the build if it tags
    ZERO independents while an ODS trust set is present (silent match failure); both real `run.py`
    entrypoints refuse to build if `nhs_trust_codes` is empty (transient ODS failure). Synthetic/tests skip.
  - **Cache-bust:** data files (except meta.json) fetched via `durl()` with `?v=<token>`, token = dynamic
    `meta.built_at` digits; meta.json fetched `no-store`. `?v=` is part of the cache key, so a new
    index.html can never pair with a stale index.json. 52 tests.
- **Live checks:** RTT Independent Sector populated (423 tagged / 381 visible), cancer unchanged (28 / 11
  visible); data requests carry `?v=<built_at token>` (meta.json stays bare/no-store); CI ODS live fetch ran
  (556 trust codes), both RTT gates passed, no guard tripped. recon + ODS fail-soft intact.

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27958596878, build+deploy GREEN; CI commit f7adeee)
- **Provider-TYPE picker filter, BOTH dashboards.** A segmented [NHS Trusts | Independent Sector] control
  scopes the org dropdown on the Providers view only (England/Commissioners unaffected), **default NHS
  Trusts** (independent-sector opt-in, so the ~32 young IS clinics drop off the default RTT list). Split is
  by ODS PRIMARY role — NHS trust (RO197/RO107) vs non-NHS-trust (everything else; the lone RO157 "non-NHS
  org" and any future odd role fold into Independent Sector → no "Other" bucket). Both dashboards a clean
  two-way split: cancer 173/28, RTT 171/423. Deep-link safety: a `?org=` link follows the org's type so the
  filter never hides it. `pipeline_common/ods.py` emits `nhs_trust_codes` (556) into the shared cache; builds
  tag provider index entries `ptype:"independent"` (absent => NHS trust, fail-open). 51 tests.
- **Live checks:** ptype tags present (cancer 173/28, RTT 171/423, no ICB tagged); default Providers = NHS
  Trusts (Airedale RCF) on each; switch → Independent re-scopes (RTT NPR01 / cancer NYT); deep-link
  ?org=NPR01 / ?org=NYT → filter auto-switches to Independent and shows the org. CI: ODS live fetch ran for
  both pipelines (not the fallback); both RTT gates intact (recon OK, TF-sum max|Δ|=0); ODS fail-soft path
  unchanged.

## ✅ DEPLOYED + LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (run 27948177203, build+deploy GREEN; CI commit aa3c52b)
- **Self-updating ODS org-status feature, BOTH dashboards** + **Part A RTT copy ×3** shipped together in one
  watched workflow_dispatch. Three lifecycle states (current / former-but-selectable / hidden) from ODS ORD
  succession links via shared `pipeline_common/ods.py` (FORMER = succession-link-passed, NOT Status); young
  orgs shown from month one; fail-soft to committed `ods_classification.json`. 50 tests pass.
- **Live checks (all explicit, headless + curl):** both dashboards 200; ODS fetch ran in CI for BOTH
  pipelines ("classified 416 orgs, 344 former, as_of 2026-05-07" — live path, not fallback); both RTT
  fail-loud gates intact (recon OK, TF-sum max|Δ|=0); QNQ/Frimley in Former group, selectable, 48mo history
  to Mar-2026, related-orgs note (→ S0E4D/S9B9J/QRL); Z9B2Z young, shown from its single Apr-2026 month, NOT
  hidden, "Formed" note; "Former organisations" picker group renders on each; Part A banner/footer/subtitle
  live with dynamic dates ("Data to April 2026. Last updated 22 June 2026"); un-hide-only confirmed
  (RTT 96→64, cancer 66→59, live_hidden ⊆ before_hidden, 0 wrongly-dropped); fail-soft re-confirmed
  (simulated outage → committed-cache fallback, no crash). Classification cache is a committed BUILD INPUT
  at repo root (not in the Pages artefact — it reaches users baked into index.json).
- Note: cancer data ends Mar-2026 (publication lag), so its 6 new ICB codes appear automatically when April
  CWT publishes; RTT already carries them. YOUNG_WINDOW_MONTHS=12 left simple per user (new IS clinics
  accepted as honest current providers).

## RTT dashboard (second dashboard, /rtt/) — increments 1 & 2 BUILT, NOT deployed ⏸
Parallel stack to the cancer one: `pipeline_rtt/` (config + build), `tests_rtt/` (9 tests),
`site/rtt/index.html` + `site/rtt/data/`. Source = the monthly RTT "Full CSV data file" (Incomplete
pathways, Part_2), 49 months Apr-2022→Apr-2026, NONC excluded, 6 metrics derived from the 105
wait-bands. 642 orgs (594 providers [96 hidden], 48 ICBs) + national. **TWO fail-loud gates pass**:
national vs Apr-2025 SPN (pct18 59.73%, waitlist 7.39M, w78/w104 exact, w52/w65 within 1%) AND the
TF-sum gate (24,776 org-months: sum of 23 TFs == C_999 total, max|Δ|=0). Front end reuses cancer
CSS/picker/range/expand/export/England mechanics; three cards = the measure toggle [% within 18wk ·
Waiting-list · Long waiters]; % chart = cancer CMB model + 65/70/92% lines; NEW count chart
(auto-scaling numeric axis); **treatment-function breakdown selector** (grouped Specialty/Other, 23
TFs) drives all three measures, with low-reliability (n<10) markers + matched England overlay + empty-TF
state; long-waiters [52·65·78·104] sub-control. Feb-2024 break marker+banner on all measures. 41 tests
pass (32 cancer + 9 RTT). **Functionally complete** (picker + 3 measures + 2 chart types + TF
breakdown + reuse mechanics). REMAINING: polish, deploy + CI/cron — awaiting the user. See DECISIONS.md
2026-06-19 (increments 1 & 2).

## Deployed and live ✅

- **Live site (post-restructure 2026-06-20):** https://drjmartins.github.io/waiting-times/
  — root landing → **/cancer/** (relocated Cancer dashboard + compare) and **/rtt/** (RTT dashboard).
  Old URL https://drjmartins.github.io/cancer-waiting-times/ now a stub repo doing a query/path-preserving
  redirect to …/waiting-times/cancer/.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/drjmartins/waiting-times (renamed from cancer-waiting-times; public)
- **Deploy:** GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/update-data.yml` (daily cron
  `0 16 * * *` + manual `workflow_dispatch`). Build runs tests → fetches any new
  NHS files → rebuilds `site/data` → commits data back (only when something other
  than `meta.json`'s timestamp changed) → deploys the Pages artefact. Source is
  genuine NHS England CWT data (OGL v3.0), 2022-23 → 2025-26.
- **CI hardening (2026-06-10):** actions pinned to Node 24-capable majors
  (checkout v6, setup-python v6, upload-pages-artifact v5, deploy-pages v5) ahead
  of the 16 Jun Node 20 removal; the commit step no longer makes a daily no-op
  "Auto update CWT data" commit (skips when only `meta.json` built_at changed).

### Per-org page — v2 → v4, all shipped & verified live
- **v2 redesign:** National default, grouped picker, ONE big time-series chart +
  three summary cards (latest % + sparkline) that switch the standard, hover
  tooltips, target-aware card cues.
- **v3 breakdown filtering:** load-on-demand per-org breakdown files
  (`org/<CODE>.breakdown.json` + `national.breakdown.json`, gitignored, rebuilt
  each run); single-dim + published pairwise slices (no Cartesian cross), UI
  reshapes per standard (FDS28 = cancer only), slice-matched national line,
  sub-threshold months shown-but-flagged.
- **v4 visual refinements (live as of run 27281517441):** (1) National/Providers/
  Commissioners type buttons + dependent dropdown (defaults to first org so the
  chart never blanks); (2) both org + breakdown dropdowns searchable (type-to-
  filter); (3) Size-of-the-prize follows the active standard — selector removed,
  slider kept; (4) legend shows marker dot + line matching the chart; (5) low-
  reliability (n<10) recoloured grey → muted org teal (`--org-muted`), distinct
  from the grey England line, still de-emphasised.

### Verified on the first watched deploy (all four checks) — still holding
1. Actions run green and the Pages site loads (200s across pages + data).
2. The checkout-without-`data/raw` re-fetch path works (clean-runner re-fetch +
   committed manifest+store back).
3. Download slices resolve on the live site (per-FY CSVs, headline extract,
   gzipped full file). `downloads/` + the breakdown files are artefact-only
   (gitignored, rebuilt every run into the Pages artefact).
4. Daily cron registered; the no-op path rebuilds + deploys cleanly (and, since
   the CI fix, without making a commit).

### Cancer-type aggregation (NHS's ten groups) + shared group filter (v5) — SHIPPED
- **PART A pipeline:** `pipeline/cancer_groups.py` rolls raw Cancer_Type labels into
  NHS England's ten tumour-site groups (sourced from NHS's own label hierarchy + CWT
  Monitoring Dataset Guidance v10.0; the only inferred mappings are the four
  FDS28-only sites with no dashboard group → Other). Added as a `cancer_group` dim in
  the per-org breakdown files ALONGSIDE the raw dims. Gate PASSED: the ten groups
  reconcile EXACTLY to the all-cancers total for all 27,816 org-month-standard cells
  across FDS28/CMB31/CMB62 (max |Δ|=0).
- **PART B front end:** shared searchable "Cancer group" selector above the three
  cards drives all three cards + big chart + size-of-the-prize together; persists
  across standard/org switches; default All cancers; muted-teal low-reliability
  (n<10) treatment on thin group sparklines + card caveat. Shared-group and
  big-chart granular filter are mutually-exclusive lenses (CONFIRMED at review).
- **Polish shipped same cycle:** Other-group cross-standard caveat (hint + tooltip);
  accurate "latest month, same rate as the card" basis label on the prize (the
  pooled-rate concern was a premise error — the per-org prize uses the latest single
  month and already matches the card; see `DECISIONS.md`). 25 tests pass.

### Item 1 — "Size of the prize" removed (2026-06-11) — DEPLOYED ✅
User wanted it gone, not hidden. Section + CSS + JS + call sites removed; no data
change (it read only core series fields). Deployed standalone (run 27339479076,
green) and verified live (zero prize refs).

### Items 2 & 3 — v6 context-aware breakdown dropdowns — DEPLOYED ✅
Group-aware **Referral route** dropdown + all-cancers-only **Treatment modality**
dropdown, built on the ≥1% activity bar (route characterisation showed routes are
partly cancer-specific — see `DECISIONS.md`). New `cancer_group_route` pipeline dim
(ten groups × route, composite groups aggregated, ≥1% per-org filter, fail-loud
reconciliation guard + store test). Front end uses a composite GROUP/ROUTE/MOD
state; spec's hide-and-reset transitions implemented. 30 tests pass; all 5 review
cases + transition + invalid-route reset rendered (screenshots/v6_a..f). Two
interpretation calls were accepted by the user as-is: raw cancer-subtype +
bare-modality breakdown options dropped (the ten-groups + route model is enough —
see deferred item below); FDS28 keeps its "no breakdowns published" line rather than
gaining a stage dropdown.

### v7 — labelling/copy + data items + org-hiding — DEPLOYED ✅ (2026-06-12, run 27406241866)
Full set live + verified. Part 1: new title/subtitle, grouped provider/commissioner
pickers (Trust/ICB first; data classifies cleanly 173/28 + 42/8), byline prefixes
dropped, group helper text removed, Oct-2023 banner moved below the chart, redundant
third footer line removed. Part 2: Missing/Invalid excluded from "Other" (sentinel
EXCLUDED_GROUP; gap is FDS28-only ~0.28%, CMB31/CMB62 still exact; reconciliation
test one-directional); composite-group composition descriptions sourced from
cancer_groups -> meta.json (drift-guarded); Oct-2023 dashed "standards changed"
marker on CMB31/CMB62 charts only. Part 3: negligible-activity orgs hidden from the
picker, computed DYNAMICALLY each build, SELECTION-ONLY (files written, org in
store/downloads + reachable by ?org=) — commissioners with recent-3-month pooled
denom < 2000 (8 hubs). **v7.1 (same day):** provider rule TIGHTENED to a recent
window — hide if no standard clears n>=10 in a single month over the LAST 12 MONTHS
(config.PICKER_PROVIDER_WINDOW_MONTHS), catching dormant/defunct-merged codes that a
historical-only rule missed (now 58 providers hidden, 185 selectable); banner made
CMB31/CMB62-only (hidden on FDS28); banner's "defaults to 2023-10 onward" trailer
removed; footer gained a transparency note about the hiding. Live: CSH Surrey + the
dormant codes hidden, all reachable by ?org=. 32 tests pass.

### Chart-polish series (v8–v14) — ALL SHIPPED ✅ (2026-06-15)
A run of front-end-only (site/index.html, no pipeline/data change) visual passes on the
per-org page, deployed and verified live. v8/v9 (run 27547584946 / 27548485696): label/legend
tidy-up, "National"→"England", provider-dropdown layout fix, index gap fix, "Beta" relabels +
compare-page header. v10–v14 bundled into ONE deploy (run 27560316331, build+deploy GREEN,
verified live) — thirteen changes to the big breakdown chart + cards:
- **Title/hint:** group hint removed; chart title = `standard — cancer group` always (incl.
  All cancers); route/modality dropped from the title (read from the dropdowns).
- **Legend:** one line, organisation-only labels —
  "this organisation · low reliability (n<10) · provisional | England · target".
- **England line:** faint SOLID grey (dashed reserved for the org's own uncertain states) so
  it never collides with a provisional org line.
- **Annotations clear of data:** "standards changed" parked in a header strip (BG.P.t); the
  "target NN.N%" label moved into the right margin (BG.P.r).
- **Markers + precedence:** uncertain states shape-distinct — provisional = open circle +
  dashed, low-reliability (n<10) = open square + dotted — both in the SAME lighter teal, so
  shape+dash carry the distinction; final = strong solid teal + filled circle. Per-point state
  mutually exclusive, PROVISIONAL WINS (a both-states point renders provisional; square =
  final-but-low only).
- **Card sparklines:** brought in line with the chart's colour logic (lighter teal for
  provisional/low-n segments, strong solid teal for final); latest-point amber/teal target-cue
  dot deliberately kept (the at-a-glance "meeting target now?" signal).

### v15 — per-org chart: time-range + expand + image export — DEPLOYED ✅ (2026-06-16, run 27619479528)
Live + verified (build+deploy green; headless live render confirms 3y/12mo/All + FDS28 marker
behaviour). Three front-end-only additions to the per-org big chart (site/index.html), built to compose
(chart renders in the modal first, then export reads what's on screen, all respecting the range):
- **Time range** — fixed ROLLING window, segmented presets [3 years · 12 months · All],
  default 3 years (36mo), applied to ALL standards incl. FDS28. Clips the big chart's org +
  England series (cards' sparklines untouched). Adaptive x-axis labels (~8–10). The Oct-2023
  in-chart marker shows ONLY when the visible window includes pre-break data, and NEVER on
  FDS28 (verified clean in 3y/12mo/All); once the rolling window clears Oct-2023 (~2027) it
  drops out on its own, banner-below still carries the note.
- **Expand** — toolbar Expand button opens the chart in a fullscreen modal by MOVING the live
  panel into it (route/modality dropdowns, tooltips, export all keep working); ✕ / Esc /
  backdrop close. `?expand=open` hook.
- **Download** — PNG + SVG of a self-contained export (title + organisation + legend + the
  on-screen chart, CSS vars resolved, fonts inlined). Captures the on-screen slice AND window;
  filename + subtitle title-cased (e.g. Airedale-NHS-Foundation-Trust-CMB62-Haematology.png).

### v16 — per-org chart: show/hide England comparison line — DEPLOYED ✅ (2026-06-16, run 27620549350)
Live + verified (build+deploy green; headless live render confirms ON/OFF + England-tab behaviour).
A "Show England" checkbox in the chart filter row (default ON), providers + commissioners only.
OFF hides the grey England series, its legend entry and its pull on the y-scale (org series,
target, Oct-2023 marker, axis all stay); hidden on the England tab (the org's own line IS England
there). One switch — it gates ACTIVE_NAT in renderBig — so it carries into the expand modal and
the PNG/SVG export, and composes with the time-range window. Persists across switches; deep-link
hook `?england=off`.

## Open items
1. **11 June decommission verification — user to run on/after 11 Jun 2026.** The
   pre-deploy check confirmed the pipeline pulls the surviving Combined (ICB-based)
   source, not the decommissioned provider flat files. A copy-paste verification
   block (live discover + column-mapping + `gh run list`) was handed over; run it
   to close the residual. CI's fail-loud `normalise.py` + test gate protects the
   daily refresh meanwhile (a bad layout fails the run rather than shipping).
2. **NEXT TASK — data cleaning.** To be scoped in the planning session before any
   build. Not started.
3. **Deferred (v6).** Cancer sub-type breakdown control. The v6 dropdown narrows
   cancer to NHS's ten groups (+ group-aware route); the finer raw cancer-subtype
   level (e.g. 'Haematological - Lymphoma') is no longer pickable in the UI. The
   data STILL RETAINS the sub-type level (the `cancer` dim in the breakdown files),
   so a sub-type control can be added later if anyone misses it — a deferral, not a
   data loss.
4. **Parked.** (a) "Compare this trust" cross-link from the per-org page into the
   comparison view (planned, not built). (b) Overdispersion ↔ study-protocol
   alignment — a methods decision for the research side (multiplicative Winsorised
   φ vs additive random-effects, Winsorisation fraction, whether to adjust).

## Known things to keep an eye on
- FDS28 funnel has very high φ (~80) — verified not degenerate (15 trusts beyond
  95%, 4 beyond 99.8%), so adjustment isn't masking all outliers. Re-check if NHS
  data shifts. See `DECISIONS.md`.
- ICB as a comparator scope is deliberately deferred (trust↔ICB is many-to-many);
  needs an attribution convention from the study protocol before building.

## Running locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
