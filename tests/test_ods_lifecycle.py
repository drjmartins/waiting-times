"""
Tests for the shared ODS org-status lifecycle feature (pipeline_common/ods.py +
its use in both builds). No network: these exercise the pure classification
helpers and the young-org / former-org logic against synthetic inputs.

Guards:
  1. annotate_entry stamps the right fields for former vs newly-formed orgs, and
     is a no-op for an unclassified (current, no-succession) org — so the lean
     index files stay lean and absent-from-cache => plain current org.
  2. YOUNG PROTECTION: a current-per-ODS org whose series first appears within the
     window is NEVER hidden (shown from month one) — in BOTH builds — while a
     former+dormant org and the pre-existing current-but-defunct safety net still
     hide. This is the bug fix: thin-because-new must not be auto-hidden.
