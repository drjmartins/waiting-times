# Negligible-activity orgs are hidden from the picker/default lists but kept in
# the store, the downloads, and reachable by direct ?org= link (and still render
# with the usual low-reliability flags). Computed DYNAMICALLY each build, so an
# org crossing the bar appears automatically and a dormant one drops. Rules,
# confirmed against the activity distribution (DECISIONS.md 2026-06-12):
#   * a PROVIDER is hidden if NO standard clears RELIABILITY_THRESHOLD (n>=10) in a
#     single month within the last PICKER_PROVIDER_WINDOW_MONTHS — i.e. negligible
#     RECENT activity, so it only produces empty/greyed charts now. The 12-month
#     window catches the genuinely dormant (incl. defunct/merged codes) while the
#     full-year requirement avoids reporting-lag false positives a 3-month window
#     would wrongly hide (an org active within the year but yet to report the latest
#     provisional months). Clean gap: dormant orgs sit at <=9 over the last year,
#     the next genuinely-active org at 22. Hides 58 providers.
#   * a COMMISSIONER is hidden if its recent-3-finalised-month pooled all-cancers
#     denominator (summed across standards) is below PICKER_MIN_COMMISSIONER_DENOM —
#     isolating the specialised/national commissioning hubs (<=869) from real ICBs

# ODS is "young" — thin because it is newly created (e.g. a just-merged ICB), NOT
# dormant. Young orgs are checked FIRST and protected from the inactivity-hiding
# rule above, so a brand-new code shows from its first month (the existing
# "no year-ago data" note + n<10 flag handle the thin view). ODS status is what
# separates young (current) from dormant (former) — both can have minimal data.
