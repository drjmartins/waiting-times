Configuration for the RTT (Referral to Treatment) waiting-times pipeline.

Sibling to the cancer-waiting-times pipeline (pipeline/). Single source of truth
for: where the data lives, the standard/milestones, the series break, and the
national reconciliation gate that guards every build.

Data model (settled 2026-06-19, see DECISIONS.md):
  * Source = the monthly "Full CSV data file" (one CSV inside a ZIP, ~85MB),
    the RTT analogue of cancer's "Monthly Combined CSV". One file PER MONTH.
  * Grain = Provider x Commissioner x RTT-Part-Type x Treatment-Function, with
    105 one-week wait-band columns. We use ONLY the Incomplete pathway type
    (Part_2) and the all-treatment-function total row (C_999) this increment.
  * Every headline metric is derived from the wait-band columns; the Total /
    unknown-clock-start summary columns are blank in the Full CSV.
